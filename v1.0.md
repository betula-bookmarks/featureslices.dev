## Usage

In that examples TypeScript used as common language, but you free to choose.

### Applications

- [Authmenow](https://github.com/authmenow/frontend) `Work in progress`

### Examples

- [Effector React SSR](https://github.com/sergeysova/effector-ssr-typescript-react-styled)
- [CreateReactApp Effector template](https://github.com/sergeysova/cra-template-effector)

## Introduction

FeatureSlices define your frontend application structure as easy and convenient.

### Convention

- All files and directories has name in param-case. Because it lowers cognitive load to select case for concrete file. One case for all files. File structure should define what type file have. Example: `component-name.tsx`

### Structure

Source code of the application contained in `src`:

- `api`
- `features`
- `lib`
- `pages`
- `ui`

#### Api

This is reusable functions or classes to make requests to the server. It is can be REST-like, GraphQL, WebSocket, etc.

Code in the `api` can be partially generated (swagger or OpenAPI).

What is API:

```
src/
  api/
    api-name.ts
    request.ts
```

For example `api-name` is a group of requests, having a common purpose. More that one namespace can be created.

Not recommended to add `src/api/index.ts` file, because different api should be separated one from one. If you import `api/user`, you see just requests related to user. But if you import `api`, you can be drowned in tons of requests for application.

Example:

```
src/
  api/
    post.ts
    feed.ts
    session.ts
    request.ts
```

In this example: `post`, `feed`, `session` is a namespaced requests, but `request` is a base function, to make requests.

Example `post.ts`:

```ts
import { request } from './request'

interface PostNew {
  title: string;
  content: string;
}

export const postsList = () => request({ method: "GET", path: "/posts" })

export const postCreate = (post: PostNew) => request({ method: "POST", path: "/posts", body: post })

export const postGet = (postId: string) => request({ method: "GET", path: `/posts/${postId}` })
```

Structure and shape of each method on your own. But it should be consistent with all other requests.

> Recommended to setup imports in your project, to allow import from root (`src/`) or use some aliases.

From `api` source code you can import only `src/lib` and package dependencies, nothing more.

**Good:**

```ts
import { postsList } from 'api/post'
// or
import * as posts from '@api/post'
```

**Bad:**

```ts
import { posts } from '../../../api'
```

#### Features

It is list of your reusable code and shared state, groupped by one idea or entity.

Structure:

```
src/
  features/
    feature-name/
      components/
      models/
      templates/
      __tests__/
      index.ts
      readme.md
      stories.tsx
```

- One feature can depends on another feature. But not recommended to do it too often.
- Do not make cyclic dependencies, when feature A depends on feature B, feature B on C, and C depends on A. Prefer tree over graph.
- Export all entities from your feature through `index.ts`. It is helps to support your feature easier, because through that public interface, you can known what is used, and what can be refactored without stress.
- Write tests and documentation for feature, to ease understanding how to use it.
- You can have as many features as you need, but no more.

Feature structure:

- `components/` here should be atoms, molecules and organisms of your features. All should be related to single idea or entity.
- `models/` here place business-logic, that can be reused (instantiated) or shared between other features and pages. Any shared state also here.
- `templates/` it is a place for atomic design templates for pages. Templates also should be relate to one idea or entity.
- `__tests__/` or `tests/` — any name of the directory to write integration or smoke tests.
- `index.ts` — public interface of your feature, all entities and units should be imported through this file. Import from inside is restricted.
  - Bad: `import {Some} from 'features/example/components/some`
  - Good: `import {Some} from 'features/example'`
- `readme.md` — documentation of your feature
- `stories.tsx` — if you use storybook


#### Lib

Common `utils` or `helper` code should be groupped by meaning and placed at its own library in this directory.

Example:
> You have two functions: parse a string to a username, and parse an array of strings to list of usernames.
> Instead of placing a first function to a `lib/string`, and a second to a `lib/array`, group it by meaning: username.
> The best place: `lib/username`

Structure

```
src/
  lib/
    lib-name/
      index.ts
      readme.md
      tests.ts
```

- Spend some time to think about name for library and internal structure.
- Write documentation and test for your library.
- Treat to library as it is writen to publish to npm. It should have good coverage, easy to understand documentation.

#### Pages

What is page? Page is a component rendered on specific url. Or another router's unit, that separates one component of another.

Structure:

```
src/
  pages/
    page-name/
      index.tsx
      model.ts
    another/
      nested/
        index.tsx
        model.ts
      index.tsx
      model.ts
    paths.ts
    routes.ts
    index.ts
```

- Each page is a pair: component and model files.
- In component file you should place page component, also you can place here another unique components that makes page rich.
- Page component's name should be built from page's route with suffix `Page`. Example: `/register/confirm` — `RegisterConfirmPage`
- In model file you should place logic for that page.
- Extra files:
  - `paths.ts` - contains map from route name to route path
  - `routes.ts` - contains common router configuration
  - `index.ts` - contains render for routes configuration
- You can merge `paths`, `routes` and `index` in a single file, if you don't need it separated.

Example component file:

```tsx
// src/pages/register/confirm/index.ts
import * as React from 'react'
import { Just } from '@app/ui'

import * as model from './model'

export const RegisterConfirmPage: React.FC = () => {
  model.useLogic();

  return (
    <RegisterConfirmContent>
      Hello from registration confirmation page
    </RegisterConfirmContent>
  )
}

const RegisterConfirmContent: React.FC = ({ children }) => (
  <Just example>
    {children}
  </Just>
)
```

Example model file:

```ts
// src/pages/register/confirm/model.ts
import * as React from 'react'

export const useLogic = () => {
  React.useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Handle on mount here")
  }, [])
}
```

Example paths file:

- Functions is used here, to consistent create path with parameters and without.
- You should use this functions in all application to redirect or create links. It is helps when you want to change path.

```ts
// src/pages/paths.ts

export const paths = {
  home: () => `/`,
  login: () => `/login`,
  register: () => `/register`,
  registerConfig: (code: string) => `/register/confirm/${code}`,
}
```

Example routes file:

```ts
// src/pages/routes.ts
import { paths } from './paths'

import { HomePage } from './home'
import { LoginPage } from './login'
import { RegisterPage } from './register'
import { RegisterConfirmPage } from './register/confirm'
import { Error404Page } from './error404'

// react-router-config example
export const routes = [
  {
    path: paths.home(),
    exact: true,
    component: HomePage,
  },
  {
    path: paths.login(),
    exact: true,
    component: LoginPage,
  },
  {
    path: paths.register(),
    exact: true,
    component: RegisterPage,
  },
  {
    path: paths.registerConfig(':code'), // pass path parameter
    exact: true,
    component: RegisterConfirmPage,
  },
  {
    path: '*',
    component: Error404Page,
  },
]
```

Example pages index file:

```ts
// src/pages/index.ts
import { renderRoutes } from 'react-router-config';
import { routes } from './routes'

export const Pages = () => renderRoutes(routes)
```

Now `Pages` component can be easily used in `Application` to bootstrap routing.

Example application file:

```tsx
// src/application.tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import * as ReactDOM from 'react-dom'
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom'
import { GlobalTemplate } from '@app/ui'
import { Pages } from './pages'

const Application = () => (
  <GlobalTemplate>
    <Pages />
  </GlobalTemplate>
)

ReactDOM.render(
  <BrowserRouter>
    <Application />
  </BrowserRouter>,
  document.querySelector("#root"),
)
```
